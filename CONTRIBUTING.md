# How to contribute to EDAM

__Your pull requests, issues, comments and suggestions are warmly welcome!__ üôèüèΩüôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Note:** If you don't want to edit an OWL file (RDF/XML) or deal with Git, please skip to the bottom of this file to find [**other very welcome ways to contribute**](#other-contributions). üéàüôåüèΩ


## Source code

The "source code" of EDAM is in the file `EDAM_dev.owl` (see [main](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/blob/main/EDAM_dev.owl)). The format of the source file is RDF/XML. `EDAM_dev.owl` can be editted locally (_e.g._ in a [text editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)), or online on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/#https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology). The file is too big to be editted directly on GitHub.


### New to Git?

Some neat efficient learning resources are:
 - Quick introduction|refresh of [Git and GitHub](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/02-refresher/) (101)
 - Install Git: see [here](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/01-setup) and [here](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#git)
 - Install a convenient [text editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/) ([see also](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#editor))
 - [Learn Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/) (great for both beginners and advanced)
 - [Forking](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/03-distributed/) a GitHub repository


### Git setup on your local machine

__Please make sure to read the following when you are cloning this repo:__

There is a __pre-commit [hook](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/05-hooks/)__ set up, to validate that the source code of EDAM is in the right format. To make it work, please use one of the following 2 options:

üòÆ Wait a second! __Is this too fast? Do you need a slightly more step-by-step guide?__ Then you are welcome to follow issue [#616](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues/616).


#### Option 1

This is the preferred option. Your __git__ version needs to be __2.9.0 or higher__ for the hook to work.

Please make sure to have set up the correct path to the hooks directory, globally or locally:

* Run `git config --list` from inside of your cloned _edamontology_ repo, and see if `core.hooksPath` has value `.githooks`
* To set it locally for your _edamontology_ repo: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
* To set it globally for your git: `git config --global core.hooksPath .githooks`
* To see your git config with where the variables are stored, run `git config --list --show-origin` from inside of your _edamontology_ repo

**Test option 1:**

1. Make a dummy change in `EDAM_dev.owl` using a text editor (best if you create an experimental Git branch for that), and try to commit it. The commit should work.
2. Now replace all `owl:Class` in the `EDAM_dev.owl` file with for example `wol:Class` ü¶â, and try to commit that change. The commit should fail now (returning 0), not allowing you to commit.


#### Option 2

If you want to continue using an older version of __git__ than __2.9.0__, please run the pre-commit script manually:
r
Inside the _edamontology_ repo, run: `.githooks/pre-commit` or `sh .githooks/pre-commit` (whichever works for you).

If the pre-commit script fails (_i.e._ non-zero exit code), the source code is invalid (_i.e._ not containing any _owl:Class_ string).

**Test option 2:**

1. Make a dummy change in `EDAM_dev.owl` using a text editor (best if you create an experimental Git branch for that), and run the `.githooks/pre-commit`. It should succeed, that is return a non-zero number.
2. Now replace all `owl:Class` in the `EDAM_dev.owl` file with for example `wol:Class` ü¶â, and run the script again. It should fail now, returning 0.


### Using Gitpod

_TODO_


### How to add a new concept

To add a new concept to `EDAM_dev.owl`, first find the place where to put in the code.üîç The concepts (defined as `owl:Class`) are sorted alphabetically by their URIs.
- A new _**Format**_ concept goes underneath the last _Format_, right above the first _**Operation**_ (search `<!-- http://edamontology.org/operation_0004 -->`).
- A new _**Topic**_ concept goes underneath the last _Topic_, right above the "ObsoleteClass" (`<!-- http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl#ObsoleteClass -->` on the bottom of the file).
- Similarly _**Operation**_ right above the first _Topic_ (`<!-- http://edamontology.org/topic_0003 -->`), and _**Data**_ right above the first _Format_ (`<!-- http://edamontology.org/format_1196 -->`).

Please create a new Git branch in your fork of the _edamontology_ repo, and add the one (or more) concept(s) in the right place in the `EDAM_dev.owl` file. It's usually the easiest to copy one of the following templates, and fill in the concrete information inside.üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª _N.B._: Many attributes are __optional__, please remove them completely if you're not filling them in.

Please leave 3 empty lines before and after each concept (`owl:Class`), one empty line between `<!-- http://edamontology.org/ID -->` and `owl:Class`, and no empty lines inside the `owl:Class` concept definition.üôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Please create a pull request after you push your changes; __draft__ pull requests (work in progress) are also very welcome!üëçüèΩ The maintainers will appreciate if you create separate Git branches and thus separate pull requests for solving separate issues | separate needs.üôèüèΩ However, if adding a set of **inter-related** concepts, it's the best to do that in one branch and one pull request.

You can either keep **_XXXX_** as the numeric ID, or use the number stored in `next_id` in the header of `EDAM_dev.owl`, and update the `next_id` with +1.üßôüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è When adding multiple concepts in one branch, you can use **XXX1, XXX2, ...** or `next_id` accordingly. You can also update the `oboOther:date` to the date & time of saving your file (in UTC).‚è≤ These edits are, however, **optional** (although highly appreciated!üôåüèΩ), and can be updated by maintainers when merging the pull request.üë©üèΩ‚Äçüè≠
