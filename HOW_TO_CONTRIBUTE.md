EDAM is a community project, and suggestions for additions, corrections, and other improvements are always welcome! There are 3 ways to contribute suggestions:

# Web form
Straightforward requests for one or a few changes can be made straight away on the _**EDAM Change Request**_ form:
http://tinyurl.com/EDAMChangeRequest 

Requests for many new concepts should, however, first be discussed with the EDAM core developers:

edam-core@elixir-dk.org

If you agree with the EDAM core developers on substantial additions or other changes and are funded for such developments, we are open to you becoming a temporary EDAM core developer. In any case, we will work with you to find the most efficient way to proceed, depending on your requirements, expertise and bandwidth.

We will make every effort to be responsive to your requests, given our limited resources.

When requesting a new concept:
- The **preferred label** should be a short name or phrase in common use.
- Please consider providing common **synonyms** of the preferred term.
- The **definition** should be a concise and lucid description of the concept, without acronyms, and avoiding jargon.
- Peripheral but important information can go in the **comment**.

# <a name="mailinglists"></a>Mailing lists
This is the preferred way to make suggestions that require some discussion. Please subscribe:
http://elixirmail.cbs.dtu.dk/mailman/listinfo/edam

To post to the list, mail:

edam@elixir-dk.org

You can use the same list for discussions around the use of EDAM concepts, _i.e._ for purposes of resource annotation and in software implementations.

# GitHub issue tracker
The GitHub issue tracker can be used to submit issues for which, for whatever reason, you want a public record: we prefer it is not used for any other purpose.

To open a GitHub issue you must have a GitHub account, and follow these simple steps:
- Go to https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues and click on "New issue".
- If you are not logged in, you will be asked first to log in or create an account.
- Provide a title, and a report that is concise but sufficiently detailed to be actionable.
