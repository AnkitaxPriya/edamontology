# Requesting concepts
To suggest new concepts, please use the [GitHub tracker](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/blob/master/HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE.md#github-issue-tracker-preferred).  We need at least the following for each concept:
- EDAM sub-ontology (Topic, Operation, Format, Data)
- Term

It will speed up things a lot if you can also provide:
- short description (a couple of sentences)
- URL of suggested parent
- synonyms
- URL to formal specification (Format concepts only)
- type of data representated (Format concepts only) 
- media type (Format concepts only)
- file extension (Format concepts only) 
- citation DOI (Format concepts only. Only if the article publishes the format and should be cited with every mention or use of the format!) 

If it turns out you need a lot of new concepts, we can find a more efficient way (_e.g._ shared Google sheet), and you can join us as [EDAM Editor](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology#governance-of-edam).


# GitHub issue tracker (preferred)
If you have a GitHub account, you can make requests by opening a GitHub issue:
- Go to https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues and click on "New issue".
- If you are not logged in, you will be asked first to log in or create an account.
- Provide a title, and a report that is concise but sufficiently detailed to be actionable.


# Suggestions form
Simple requests for one or a few changes can be made using this form:

If you require many changes and additions, there's probably a more efficient way to proceed: please contact edam@elixir-dk.org.
