# <a name="mailinglists"></a>Mailing lists
To find the most efficient way to contribute to EDAM, request changes and additions, and for general discussions, including the use of EDAM for resource annotation and in software implementations, mail:

We'll make every effort to be responsive, given our limited resources, and will work with you to find the most efficient way to proceed, depending on your requirements, expertise and bandwidth.

# Requesting terms
To suggest new terms, please use the GitHub tracker (see below).  We need at least the following for each concept:
- EDAM branch (Topic, Operation, Format, Data)
- Term

It will speed up things a lot if you can also provide:
- short description (a couple of sentences)
- URL of suggested parent
- synonyms
- URL to formal specification (Format concepts only)
- type of data representated (Format concepts only) 

If it turns out you need a lot of new concepts, we can find a more efficient way (e.g. shared Google sheet), and you can join us as [EDAM Editor](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology#governance-of-edam).


# GitHub issue tracker (preferred)
If you have a GitHub account, you can make requests by opening a GitHub issue:
- Go to https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues and click on "New issue".
- If you are not logged in, you will be asked first to log in or create an account.
- Provide a title, and a report that is concise but sufficiently detailed to be actionable.


# Suggestions form
Simple requests for one or a few changes can be made using this form:

If you require many changes and additions, there's probably a more efficient way to proceed: please contact edam@elixir-dk.org.
