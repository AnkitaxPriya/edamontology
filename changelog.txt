// EDAM_1.4.owl
-- under development --



// EDAM_1.3.owl
Highlights of changes:
* Greatly simplified "Topic" branch
* Many new terms added for annotating tools in the BioToolsRegistry (bioregistry.cbs.dtu.dk)



// EDAM_1.2.owl
This is the first version of EDAM now that is maintained in OWL format.  The OBO-format version is generated from it by processing the OWL file.

Highlights of changes:
* New references to MeSH
* Edits to synonyms
* About a dozen new formats

* Clean-ups for cleaner viewing in Protege and OLS:
* Removed unnecessary has_input, has_output axioms
* Cleaner annotations on the ontology itself




// EDAM_1.1.obo

Many additions (mostly in "Operation" and some in "Topic" branches) for "next generation" sequencing analysis.
EDAM now provides complete coverage of biological domains and bioinformatics methods from SeqWiki (http://seqanswers.com/wiki/SEQanswers)
SeqWiki "biological domains" map to EDAM "Topic", SeqWiki "bioinformatics methods" map to EDAM "Operation"


// EDAM_1.0.obo
The first release proper.

General changes
   * New style for concept IDs: 4 digit number, subontology namespace / subset("operation", "topic" etc)  e.g. 
    "EDAM_operation:0004" (new style) instead of "EDAM:0000004" (old style)

   * New relations (has_function, is_function_of) are defined for use by annotators (they are not used in EDAM itself)

   * Synonyms are defined that define related or relevant concepts in many other ontologies and systems.  Synonyms are added throughout but especially on top-level concepts (Operation, Data, Format and Topic) and relations (has_input, is_input_of, has_output, is_output_of, has_topic, is_topic_of, has_format, is_format_of, has_function, is_function_of) 

   * New concept attributes and modifiers have been added, most importantly:
     "{note} for comments on synonyms and other attributes, e.g.
synonym: "assembly" NARROW [SO:0001248] {note="Perhaps surprisingly, the definition of 'SO:assembly' is narrower than the 'SO:sequence_assembly'."}

     "{since} for annotation of version information, e.g. data of creation or obsoletion of a concept id:
id: EDAM_data:3165 {since=1.0}
is_obsolete: true {since=1.0}

"Format" branch
   * 10 new formats




// EDAM_beta13.obo
General changes
   * "Identifier" branch moved from top-level to beneath "Data".  The "identifier" namespace / definitions have been kept!
   * Extensive revision of "Data", "Operation" and "Topic" branches to reduce clutter and ease navigation.  
   * Bottom-up clean up removing terms that are too fine-grained. Top-down clean up to add or remove terms to aid navigation.
   * has_topic (defined on "Data" and "Operation") replaces in_topic
   * Duplicated relationships (child terms erroneously restating the inherited relationships of their parents) have been removed.

"Data" branch
   * All "Data" concepts now organised into 4 sub-concepts:
     -  "Core data" - Data that typically are the primary input or output of a tool or which correspond to entries from the primary (e.g. sequence or structural) biological databases.
     - "Identifier" - A short numerical or textual label that identifies (typically uniquely) something such as data, a resource or a biological entity.
     - "Parameter" - Typically a simple numerical or string value that controls the operation of a tool.
     - "Report" - A human-readable collection of information that is distinct from primary (e.g. sequence or structural) biological data, including free text, annotation about biological entities and phenomena, computer-generated reports of analysis of primary data and metadata.
   * "Report" concepts for sequences correspond better (without duplicating) established sequence feature keys.

"Operation" branch
   * Fewer concepts, simpler is_a hierarchy
   * "has_input" and "has_input" relations defined (on nearly all terms)

"Format" branch
   * "is_format_of" relations defined (for nearly all terms)

"Topic" branch
   * Improved term names and is_a hierarchy, reflecting whether topics concern a type of data, operation or are more general.  
   * New "Biological data resources" sub-branch includes common data resource concepts.
   * Major revision! Too much to mention, so take a look :)





// EDAM_beta12.obo
General changes
   * OBO subset definitions added
   * Sub-ontologies / namespaces / subsets now are "topic", "data", "format", "identifier", "operation"
   * Relation types now are "in_topic", "has_input", "has_output", "is_format_of", "is_identifier_of"
   * Many edits (to concepts and "is_a" relations) to improve navigability in all sub-ontologies

New "Identifier" sub-ontology
   * Containing concepts which were under Data<-Identifier
   * For fine-grained annotation of identifiers of data (see http://edamontology.sourceforge.net/#9.6)

"Resource" sub-ontology obsoleted 
   * Most concepts merged into "Topic" sub-ontology (see below)
   * All remaining concepts in "resource" namespace obsoleted

Major revisions to "Topic" sub-ontology
   * Concepts redefined as "...general bioinformatics subject or category, such as a field of study, data, processing, analysis or technology."
   * For coarse-grained annotation of diverse resources
   * Subsumes concepts from old "resource" sub-ontology (see above)

EDAM-specific relations
   * Many new relations added (most term statements which should define relations now do)
   * Relations defined on parent only (not duplicated in children)

"Format" sub-ontology
   * About 50 new formats added





// EDAM_beta11.obo
* Entire "Entity" branch (all terms) made obsolete

* Root term of "resource" namespace ("Data resource") renamed to "Resource"

* Root term of "format" namespace ("Data format") renamed to "Format"

* Corrections (2) removing duplicate IDs





// EDAM_beta10.obo
Major revision of "Operation" branch 
   * immensely simplified top level
   * better hierarchy

Major revision of "Data" branch 
   * simpler top-level 
   * better hierarchy
   * new branches for "Protein data", "Nucleic acid data"
   * new terms to aid navigation
   * clean up "annotation" and "metadata" concepts

Major revision of "Data format" branch
   * better hierarchy
   * children of "HTML format" are now (mostly) obsolete
   * many new formats added

Simplification of "Topic" branch
   * concepts are now more strictly "fields of study"

General changes
   * term relations are now defined in one direction only
   * more consistent usage of words in term names
   * more intuitive term names (child names follow parent in style where possible)
   * many term additions and deletions
